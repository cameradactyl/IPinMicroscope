# IPinMicroscope
This repository contains STL files for a small clip to hold a pinhole cut from an aluminum can in front of your phone camera lens. 
I used a 50 micron (0.05mm) pinhole and could easily focus on an ants face with an Iphone 6 plus.

Recommended print settings : 90% infill, 6 shell layers. PETG is best, PLA works too.
Cyanoacrylate (crazy glue) was used to secure the pinhole to the clip.


There is an included Drill fixture, which you can print, and use to drill an aligned pinhole in the piece of a can, AFTER you glue the can to the front side of the microscope clip.
